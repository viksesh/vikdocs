Especially after sports lineup announcements To refresh content/playlist in Tivimate go to Tivimate settings -> playlists -> update all (It will then pull in any new channels/shows/movies added. It also automatically does this when you open the app) To refresh guide in Tivimate go to Tivimate settings -> EPG -> update EPG ( I also recommend setting update interval to more frequent so your guide stays up to date). The guide is updated everyday at 9:00am EST so best to refresh after then. Sort your movies by added time to see the latest movies I add at the top I have mostly full control over the content library so let me know if you want me to add any shows/movies. Request in the support/requests groupchat by sending IMDB link. There is a ton of content, UHD channels are the best quality, others are backups for UHD, SD are lower quality. There are also tons of backup sections in case some of the main channels not working. If you are not using a 4k device(Tivo 4k recommended) and Tivimate app you are missing out! Ditch the firestick! USE NFL SECTION FOR WATCHING FOOTBALL (It will have guide set on gamedays, update EPG before game starts to see) HIGHLY recommend using a VPN if you experience lot of buffering but have good internet speeds. It will usually fix any buffering issues and protects your streaming connection. Nord VPN is an easy download and sign up on any device. YOU WILL PROBABLY NEED A VPN IF AT&T IS YOUR INTERNET PROVIDER Please ask all support related questions and movie/show requests in my groupchat on telegram It is HIGHLY important you keep track of all your logins: for my website, for your apps, tivimate premium, etc.","title":"General Guide/Tips"},{"location":"PROTIPS/#general-guidetips","text":"The apps we use for my service are mainly TIVIMATE and IPTV SMARTERS You should refresh your playlist and epg daily!

ALWAYS TRY THESE BEFORE REPORTING! CHECK DEVICE LIMIT: Check you are within your device limit and not using more devices than your plan allows! Check you havn't left other devices on. To avoid this always exit out of your app before turning off your tv. FORCE STOP AND CLEAR CACHE: On device Settings Apps Force stop and clear cache on your app. (DO NOT CLEAR DATA! OR EVERYTHING ON THAT APP WILL BE ERASED) REBOOT YOUR STICK/DEVICE: Unplug your device and plug it back in after a minute REBOOTING MODEM AND ROUTER: Unplug Modem, Router and device from wall for 5 minutes then reboot. This will clear stuff thats slowing your internet down. If you tried both steps above check your internet speed by googling 'speed test' You want to have at least 50 mbps to stream with no problems. And remember whatever your speed is, every device thats connected to your wifi is using some of that. If you have done all above and your internet speed is high and fast but still getting buffering on more than just one channel or a movie then you're probably getting throttled by your ISP and you need a VPN to bypass them. VPN Setup: 1. IPvanish or Nord VPN are what I recommend 2. You can simply download them from the app store on any device. 3. After downloading the vpn app you will sign up and then simply connect. 4. After connecting you can go back to your tv app to watch and should get no buffering. I always recommend everyone use one even if they dont have any issues. IF YOU HAVE ATT YOU LIKELY NEED A VPN. For those that have AT&T internet, they will likely block you from using my service. TO FIX THIS: You will need the AT&T Home Manager app and navigate to App Preferences and toggle off the \"AT&T Security\" or do it in the router settings. If its just a certain channel or a single movie you're having problems with it, it may just be that movie or channel. 403 error means a channel is down or it is restarting or if its a custom sports channel it means the event hasnt started or its ended. But remember every major channel has several copies or backups so u can always try that. Always try UHD channels first. Otherwise, you must tell exactly which channel it is so I can check and fix it. Report the channel or movie using this format: 1. Channel or Movie or Show full titles 2. Detailed report of your issue","title":"Troubleshooting"},{"location":"troubleshoot/#troubleshooting","text":"If you're experiencing buffering issues or your set up is not working as expected, these are the simple troubleshooting steps to do.
