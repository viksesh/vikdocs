# Troubleshoot

if u have buffering it is likely your internet or setup issue - i will post a message here - please follow steps in that message before reporting any buffering.

If you're experiencing buffering issues or your set up is not working as expected, these are the simple maintenance steps to do. ALWAYS TRY THIS BEFORE REPORTING!

FIRST: Check you are within your device limit and not using more devices than your plan allows! Check you havn't left other devices on. To avoid this always exit out of your app before turning off your tv.

FORCE STOP AND CLEAR CACHE:
On device
Settings
Apps
Force stop and clear cache on your app. (DO NOT CLEAR DATA! OR EVERYTHING ON THAT APP WILL BE ERASED)

REBOOT YOUR STICK/DEVICE:
Unplug your device and plug it back in after a minute

REBOOTING MODEM AND ROUTER:
Unplug Modem, Router and device from wall for 5 minutes then reboot. This will clear stuff thats slowing your internet down. 

If you tried both steps above check your internet speed by googling 'speed test'

You want to have at least 50 mbps to stream with no problems. And remember whatever your speed is, every device thats connected to your wifi is using some of that.

If you have done all above and your internet speed is high and fast but still getting buffering on more than just one channel or a movie then you're probably getting throttled by your ISP and you need a VPN to bypass them. 
IPvanish or Nord VPN are what I recommend - you can simply download them from the app store on any device. After downloading the vpn app you will sign up and then simply connect. After connecting you can go back to your app to watch and should get no buffering.
I always recommend everyone use one even if they dont have any issues.
IF YOU HAVE ATT YOU LIKELY NEED A VPN.
For those that have AT&T internet, they will likely block you from using my service. 
TO FIX THIS: You will need the AT&T Home Manager app and navigate to App Preferences and toggle off the "AT&T Security" or do it in the router settings.

If its just a certain channel or a single movie you're having problems with it, it may just be that movie or channel.
403 means a channel is down or it is restarting or if its a custom sports channel it means the event hasnt started or its ended.
But remember every major channel has several copies or backups so u can always try that. Always try UHD channels first.
Otherwise, you gotta tell me exactly which channel it is so I can check and fix it.

Report the channel or movie using this format:
-Channel or Movie or Show full titles
-Detailed report of your issue
