# General Guide/Tips
The apps we use for my service are mainly TIVIMATE and IPTV SMARTERS

0. You should refresh your playlist and epg daily! Especially after sports lineup announcements

1. To refresh content/playlist in Tivimate go to `Tivimate settings -> playlists -> update all` (It will then pull in any new channels/shows/movies added. It also automatically does this when you open the app)

2. To refresh guide in Tivimate go to `Tivimate settings -> EPG -> update EPG` ( I also recommend setting update interval to more frequent so your guide stays up to date). The guide is updated everyday at 9:00am EST so best to refresh after then.

3. Sort your movies by `added time` to see the latest movies I add at the top

4. I have mostly full control over the content library so let me know if you want me to add any shows/movies. Request in the support/requests groupchat by sending IMDB link.

5. There is a ton of content, `UHD` channels are the best quality, others are backups for UHD, SD are lower quality. There are also tons of backup sections in case some of the main channels not working.

6. If you are not using a 4k device(Tivo 4k recommended) and Tivimate app you are missing out! Ditch the firestick!

7. USE `NFL` SECTION FOR WATCHING FOOTBALL (It will have guide set on gamedays, update EPG before game starts to see)

8. HIGHLY recommend using a `VPN` if you experience lot of buffering but have good internet speeds. It will usually fix any buffering issues and protects your streaming connection. Nord VPN is an easy download and sign up on any device. YOU WILL PROBABLY NEED A VPN IF AT&T IS YOUR INTERNET PROVIDER

9. Please ask all support related questions and movie/show requests in my groupchat on telegram

10. It is HIGHLY important you keep track of all your logins: for my website, for your apps, tivimate premium, etc.
